## The game

In this game, you play with the Millennium Falcon, you can move left/right/up/down (with the arrows of your keyboard) and fire lasers (space bar) to shot your enemies (asteroid and TIE Fighter).

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding enemies who are raining from the sky and trying to haz you. The longer you stay alive and shot enemies, the higher your score! 

When you reach a certain score, the Death Star will appear, your final goal will be to destroy it!

Have fun!
